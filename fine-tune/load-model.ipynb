      "Cement is an inorganic compound that has been used for many years in cements, as a binder for cured materials, in order to produce a solid mass. Cement has a high compressive strength, a low water absorption, good resistance to heat, cold, moisture, fire, corrosion, erosion and other external factors, but it is not a good material for cutting tool production. Therefore, cobalt, tungsten, molybdenum, rhenium, chromium and nickel, are added to the cereal in small amounts, to improve the hardness, the wear resistance, or the other properties of cermet, so that the material is suitable for use in cutting. The cased material, is produced by compacting the mixture of raw materials in a mold, at a temperature of 200-305° C. and under pressure, for 3-5 minutes, until the desired density is achieved.\n",
