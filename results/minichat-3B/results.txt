First answer:
I'm looking for a similar movie that has a magical world, a protagonist who is a wizard, and a plot that involves a quest for something. The movie should also have a sense of adventure and danger.
One movie you might like is The Chronicles of Narnia. It has similar thematic elements, such as the idea of a fantasy world and the importance of following one's heart. However, it is not a direct sequel to the Harry potter series, but it has its own unique story and characters.
